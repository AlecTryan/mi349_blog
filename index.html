			<h2 id="Blog 1">My Inspiration</h2>
			<h2>Author: Alec Tryan</h2>
			<h2>Date: 10-11-21</h2>

			<p>Many people have influenced who I am today. Perhaps the most significant inspiration I have had is none other than my own mom. 
			Whenever I feel beaten down by the world, she is there to lend a hand and pick up my spirits. 
			She has not just encouraged me to be the best version of myself; truly, she has helped me become a far greater person than I ever would have been otherwise.</p>

			<p>Academically, she has always been my biggest fan. 
			Whether I got an A, C, or anything in between, she was always there to congratulate me when i walked into the house with report card in hand. 
			Then, she took me out to lunch on the last day of school, no matter my GPA, to show me how proud she was of my accomplishments. 
			I cannot say my self-confidence has always been all that high. No, I won't exaggerate. Despite that, my mom never failed to show me how much I am valued.</p>

			<p>As I am wrapping up my education, I am excited for what is on the horizon. I may have my doubts, but I know I will never be alone in this journey. Thank you, mom.</p>

			<h2 id="Blog 2">The Sciences</h2>
			<h2>Author: Alec Tryan</h2>
			<h2>Date: 10-12-21</h2>

			<p>Science, a topic I barely touched in years. Science, something we are all taught from a young age. 
			Physics, chemistry, biology, and so much more beyond that. I was exposed to all three in high school, but honestly, none of them spoke to me. 
			I think explosions are as cool as anyone does, but all the compounds and subscripts of chemistry class felt like a jumbled mess. 
			If I had any other teacher for chemistry than the one I had, I swear I wouldn't have made it through the year. PV=NRT? More like PV=N*R*boring. 
			That's a bit harsh, but you get the point: Chemistry was not my thing. Nor was biology, which I took at the same time in sophomore year. 
			To this day I am not sure how one teacher could assign me so homework each week. Finally, we have physics. 
			I took that class in freshman year and wish my experience with it ended there. Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to escape from it for one reason: my little sister. 
			For someone going into business, I don't even know why she is in a course on quantum mechanics. Either way, I suppose I cannot escape science.</p>
