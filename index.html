<h1 id="hello" class="section-heading">Hello World</h1>

<p>Many people have influenced who I am today. Perhaps the most significant inspiration I have had is none other than my own mom. 
Whenever I feel beaten down by the world, she is there to lend a hand and pick up my spirits. 
She has not just encouraged me to be the best version of myself; truly, she has helped me become a far greater person than I ever would have been otherwise.</p>

<p>Academically, she has always been my biggest fan. 
Whether I got an A, C, or anything in between, she was always there to congratulate me when i walked into the house with report card in hand. 
Then, she took me out to lunch on the last day of school, no matter my GPA, to show me how proud she was of my accomplishments. 
I cannot say my self-confidence has always been all that high. No, I won't exaggerate. Despite that, my mom never failed to show me how much I am valued.</p>

<p>As I am wrapping up my education, I am excited for what is on the horizon. I may have my doubts, but I know I will never be alone in this journey. Thank you, mom.</p>
